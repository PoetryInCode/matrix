# Matrix
A matrix program to get some practice with C and the [ncurses](https://github.com/mirror/ncurses) library.

This project just recently turned 4 years old, and was one of my first C projects!
I have been using it as a screen saver for my office all this time.

After staring at it running on this old CRT monitor in my office off of a Mac trash can (aka. 2013 Mac Pro)
that is running Void Linux. I decided that it could do with a makeover.
